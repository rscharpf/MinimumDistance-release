  abstract	= {Array-based technologies have been used to detect
		  chromosomal copy number changes (aneuploidies) in the human
		  genome. Recent studies identified numerous copy number
		  variants (CNV) and some are common polymorphisms that may
		  contribute to disease susceptibility. We developed, and
		  experimentally validated, a novel computational framework
		  (QuantiSNP) for detecting regions of copy number variation
		  from BeadArray SNP genotyping data using an Objective Bayes
		  Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM). Objective Bayes measures are
		  used to set certain hyperparameters in the priors using a
		  novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the model to a
		  fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters
		  are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training
		  data of known structure. QuantiSNP provides probabilistic
		  quantification of state classifications and significantly
		  improves the accuracy of segmental aneuploidy
		  identification and mapping, relative to existing analytical
		  tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation
		  of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel
		  and validated CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray
		  SNP data but it can be adapted to other platforms and we
		  believe that the OB-HMM framework has widespread
		  applicability in genomic research. In conclusion, QuantiSNP
		  is a novel algorithm for high-resolution CNV/aneuploidy
		  detection with application to clinical genetics, cancer and
		  disease association studies.},

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Genomic DNA regions are frequently lost or
		  gained during tumor progression. Array Comparative Genomic
		  Hybridization (array CGH) technology makes it possible to
		  assess these changes in DNA in cancers, by comparison with
		  a normal reference. The identification of systematically
		  deleted or amplified genomic regions in a set of tumors
		  enables biologists to identify genes involved in cancer
		  progression because tumor suppressor genes are thought to
		  be located in lost genomic regions and oncogenes, in gained
		  regions. Array CGH profiles should also improve the
		  classification of tumors. The achievement of these goals
		  requires a methodology for detecting the breakpoints
		  delimiting altered regions in genomic patterns and
		  assigning a status (normal, gained or lost) to each
		  chromosomal region. RESULTS: We have developed a
		  methodology for the automatic detection of breakpoints from
		  array CGH profile, and the assignment of a status to each
		  chromosomal region. The breakpoint detection step is based
		  on the Adaptive Weights Smoothing (AWS) procedure and
		  provides highly convincing results: our algorithm detects
		  97, 100 and 94\% of breakpoints in simulated data,
		  karyotyping results and manually analyzed profiles,
		  respectively. The percentage of correctly assigned statuses
		  ranges from 98.9 to 99.8\% for simulated data and is 100\%
		  for karyotyping results. Our algorithm also outperforms
		  other solutions on a public reference dataset.

		  measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes

		  copy number changes and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity

		  109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal
		  aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations
		  as well tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution.
		  Detected aberrations include homozygous deletions,
		  hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral LOH, duplications, and
		  amplifications. The statistical ability to detect common
		  aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome
		  titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by
		  titration of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired
		  normal cell line. Analysis was facilitated by using a
		  genome browser that plots log ratios of normalized
		  intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes. We
		  developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample
		  and a paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes
		  log intensity ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to
		  canonical genotype clusters generated from approximately
		  120 reference samples, whereas the paired sample mode uses
		  a paired normal reference sample from the same individual.
		  Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted
		  for their utility in analyzing different types of input
		  gDNA: low input amounts, fragmented gDNA, and Phi29
		  whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.},

  abstract	= {MOTIVATION: Array CGH technologies enable the simultaneous
		  measurement of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a
		  genome. We developed the circular binary segmentation (CBS)
		  algorithm to divide the genome into regions of equal copy
		  number. The algorithm tests for change-points using a
		  maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference
		  distribution to obtain the corresponding P-value. The
		  number of computations required for the maximal test
		  statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of markers. This
		  makes the full permutation approach computationally
		  prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of
		  thousands markers and highlights the need for a faster
		  algorithm. RESULTS: We present a hybrid approach to obtain
		  the P-value of the test statistic in linear time. We also
		  introduce a rule for stopping early when there is strong
		  evidence for the presence of a change. We show through
		  simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial
		  gain in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and
		  that the stopping rule further increases speed. We also
		  present the analyses of array CGH data from breast cancer
		  cell lines to show the impact of the new approaches on the
		  analysis of real data. AVAILABILITY: An R version of the
		  CBS algorithm has been implemented in the "DNAcopy" package
		  of the Bioconductor project. The proposed hybrid method for
		  the P-value is available in version 1.2.1 or higher and the
		  stopping rule for declaring a change early is available in

		  markers or functional candidates in gene-mapping studies.
		  However, unlike single nucleotide polymorphism or

		  methods are limited to detecting total copy numbers, rather
		  than copy number in each of the two homologous chromosomes.
		  To address this issue, we developed a statistical framework
		  for intensity-based CNV detection platforms using family
		  data. Our algorithm identifies CNVs for a family
		  simultaneously, thus avoiding the generation of calls with
		  Mendelian inconsistency while maintaining the ability to
		  detect de novo CNVs. Applications to simulated data and
		  real data indicate that our method significantly improves
		  both call rates and accuracy of boundary inference,
		  compared to existing approaches. We further illustrate the
		  use of Mendelian inheritance to infer SNP allele
		  compositions in each of the two homologous chromosomes in
		  CNV regions using real data. Finally, we applied our method
		  to a set of families genotyped using both the Illumina
		  HumanHap550 and Affymetrix genome-wide 5.0 arrays to
		  demonstrate its performance on both inherited and de novo
		  CNVs. In conclusion, our method produces accurate CNV
